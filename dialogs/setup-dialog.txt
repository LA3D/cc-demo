 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

 ※ Tip: Ask Claude to create a todo list when working on complex tasks to 
 track progress and remain on track

> Ok. I want to work on a quarto presentation to be deployed as 
  GitHub pages on how to work with you, claude code.

⏺ I'll help you create a Quarto presentation about working with
  Claude Code that can be deployed as GitHub Pages. Let me start by
  exploring the current directory structure and then plan this task.

     ## Project Overview
     This project creates a Quarto presentation about working with
     Claude Code, designed for deployment as GitHub Pages. The
     presentation follows Jeremy Howard's dialogue engineering
     approach from Answer.AI - working interactively in small steps
     rather than large code dumps.
     ## Working Philosophy
     We follow the **dialogue engineering** methodology:
     - Work in small, iterative steps
     - Continuous feedback between human and AI
     - Each step makes both human and AI smarter
